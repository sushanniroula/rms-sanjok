            </b>

            <p><b><u>Technology </u>("science of craft", from Greek τέχνη, techne, "art, skill, cunning of hand"; and
                    -λογία, -logia)</b> is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the
                production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific
                investigation.
                Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in
                machines to
                allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e. g. machines) applying
                technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome
                are
                referred to as technology systems or technological systems.</p>

            <p>The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of
                how
                to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the
                invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in
                historic
                times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to
                communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.</p>

            <p>Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global
                economy)
                and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products
                known
                as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have
                always
                influenced the values of a society and raised new questions of the ethics of technology. Examples
                include
                the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.
            </p>

            <p>Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology
                improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary
                movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates
                people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued
                technological
                progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.</p>
